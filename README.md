# Java Projects: Calculator and Cart System

## Overview

This repository contains two Java applications:

1. **Calculator**: A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
2. **Cart System**: A system that takes product data such as name, code, price, quantity, and checks whether the product is available based on the quantity.

These applications are designed to practice the following Java concepts:
- User input handling using `Scanner`.
- Basic arithmetic operations and conditional statements.
- Data management for a cart system.

## Files
